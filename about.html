<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I discovered my passion for Computer Science in high school and graduated 
  Purdue Northwest University with a Computer Science degree. I’ve been working 
  as a Software Developer at Applied Systems Inc. building insurance software for 4 years.
</p>

<p>I’m a creative person and I’m open to experiencing new ideas. I love watching 
  and studying classic films, reading classic and nonfiction historical books, 
  and playing and understanding retro video games. I believe understanding the 
  past is very important to understanding the future. A few other interests 
  include cooking, animation, and I’m a huge Lord of the Rings fan.
</p>

<p>Presently, I’ve been challenging myself to learn 3D-modeling and game design. 
  I hope to leverage my Computer Science background to one day work professionally 
  in the video games industry. The purpose of this website is to share and 
  demonstrate my creations. Thanks for taking the time to visit the site and take care!
